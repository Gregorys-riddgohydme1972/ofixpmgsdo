Just got out of Antes del cuerpo and wow, my mind's like a spilled popcorn bucket, scattered and messy all over this sticky theater floor. Man, sitting here with a backache, not sure if it’s from the movie or these seats—who invented these torture devices anyway?

The movie, yeah, it’s like someone painted emotions with a brush too big for the canvas—sometimes messy, sometimes spot on. That scene with the little girl and the butterfly, it’s still flapping around in my head. Reminded me of the time we tried to save those moths, you remember? Felt real, yet absolutely surreal, just like that.

> Had to keep telling myself to breathe. Seriously, I think I forgot a couple of times—such intensity! It’s like when you’re riding a bike and suddenly you're not sure if you know how to stop. One of those. Such powerful pauses in-between chaos, you know? And then the chaos itself, like when my washing machine goes berserk during the spin cycle.

The couple in the movie... could see reflections of us, or maybe everyone somehow? Download the movie if you get a chance. Thought I saw some of their feelings stretch like bubblegum; you think it’ll snap, but no, just keeps going, impossibly pink and sticky.

Dazed, leaving the theater—a bee buzzing at the edge of my consciousness. Noise as loud as my thoughts, people shuffling around like they’re still trying to process the colors and sounds, like birds after a storm. Oh, forgot to mention, the whole segment in the rain was... can’t find the words. Just go watch the movie. It’s a waterfall of feelings, like an unexpected rainstorm when you didn’t bring an umbrella.

My thumbs are cold, could be the air conditioning. Wish I had saved that last bit of nachos, they were warm at least. Brain’s replaying those close-ups—the actor's faces are etched somewhere in my mind now. Like, printed, you know? Might reappear in a dream with mismatched shoes.

Gotta wrap this up—brain’s melting into slush. Anyway, here’s an error that popped up on my last coding session. dunno how it landed here but, maybe it means something? Or nothing. Who knows.

```c
int main() {
    // why is this even here?
    printf(Hello, World);
    return 0 // missing semicolon, oops!
}
```

Guess I’ll just breathe and let it all settle in, like a snow globe.
